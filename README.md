ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

Iâ€™m a Data Engineer at SIDC, passionate about applying machine learning techniques to financial datasets. 
My current focus is on developing and evaluating a risk index tailored to Iran's financial landscape.

I primarily work with Python and MATLAB, and Iâ€™m diving deep into scraping and organizing Codal data to unlock valuable insights.

I specialize in making unfunny jokesâ€”because why not? :D

Feel free to connect or collaborate!
